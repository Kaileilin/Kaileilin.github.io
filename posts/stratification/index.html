							<h1><b> From Agricultural Land to the Next Remote Worker's Hub: The City of Escondido's Path to Economic well-being</b></h1>
							<h3>Three years since the COVID, major cities are still growing fast. But work and housing shifts are opening up opportunities for Smaller size Cities like Escondido</h3>
							<p><i><small>By Kailei Lin

						<p>Forecasting the economic standing of a city over a 10-year period is a challenging task that requires considering numerous variables and uncertainties. While I cannot provide a definitive prediction, this analysis will explore several factors that could potentially shape the future economic landscape of the City of Escondido.</p>
						<p>Escondido, a charming city nestled within the renowned biotech hub of San Diego County, enjoys an array of benefits stemming from its strategic location. Much like numerous other modest-sized towns across the United States, Escondido reaps the rewards of being situated within this thriving biotechnology and life sciences region. With its young and vibrant population, the city boasts a median age of 29, significantly lower than the California state average.
							While Escondido possesses the potential for an innovative and dynamic workforce to bolster its economy, it is not without its share of struggles and challenges. The city currently faces certain obstacles that hinder its growth and progress.
							 </p>

							 <h2><i>4% of the workers in Escondido are considered High-Wage Earners(>$60,000) and of all high-wage industries, only Professional, scientific, and management is a specialization of Escondido(LQ>1)
							</i></h2>

							<p> A high-wage job, as defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), pertains to an industry or occupation where the average wage surpasses the overall average by at least 50%. In Escondido, high-wage jobs refer to individuals with annual household incomes exceeding $60,000, whereas the low-wage category encompasses individuals with annual household incomes below $60,000. Escondidoâ€™s high wage industry has experienced more rapid growth compared to the rest of the industry, particularly since 2018, averaging a 6% employment growth per year from 2018 to 2021. Some of the high wage industry in Escondido includes Computer and engineering, healthcare and financial operations.Median earnings in Escondido rose steadily from around $38,500 in 2017 to more than $46,000 in 2021, while mean earnings rose from around $51,500 to $61,000 in the same period.</p>

							<P>When analyzing Escondido's employment trends over the past five years and its Location Quotient, it becomes evident that mature industry clusters have formed in Construction and Other Services, with the exception of public administration. Despite facing a significant decline of 62.6% and 22% respectively since 2016, these industries continue to be the primary areas of regional specialization in the U.S. This is a testament to their resilience and importance in the region, as they continue to attract and sustain a skilled workforce.</P>
							<br></br>

							<p>Escondido possesses a distinct competitive edge in the Construction sector when compared to the rest of the county. To enhance the region's median household income, it is crucial to integrate Construction with other high-tech industries. Achieving this integration requires developers to strategically optimize land utilization. </p>

						<h2><i> More than 40% of the households in Escondido are Renters
							   <br><h4>60% of them pay over 30% of their annual Income</br></h4></i></h2>

							   <p>Recent data(2021) from the American census survey reveals that 40 percent of households in Escondido are renters. A comparison with other cities across the nation with similar median rent as Escondido indicates that the city (marked as a yellow dot in the figure below) falls towards the lower end concerning median income.

								As the median income surpasses $50,000, there is a significant decrease in the renter population. This suggests that higher median incomes positively impact homeownership rates, contributing to greater stability in the housing market. </p>

							   <h2><i>More than 40% of the households in Escondido are Renters
								<br><h4>60% of them pay over 30% of their annual Income</br></h4></i></h2>
							   <p>The ripple effect of an economy is indeed significant, and one crucial factor that can enhance this effect is having a substantial number of workers residing within the city. When workers live in the city, it leads to increased direct spending in the region, which, in turn, boosts tax revenues for the government. However, in 2021, the data indicates that only 76.6 percent of the workers employed in Escondido were living within the area, while 83.2 percent of the residents were living in Escondido but outside the city.

								This trend is foreseeable, given the lower wages but relatively higher living costs in Escondido. To address this issue and foster a more favorable economic landscape, it becomes imperative for local authorities and stakeholders to explore strategies that can encourage workers to reside within the city. This could involve initiatives to increase affordable housing options, improve job opportunities, and enhance the overall quality of life in Escondido. By attracting more residents to live within the city limits, Escondido can tap into the potential of a more vibrant local economy, leading to increased spending and higher tax revenues that can benefit the community as a whole.</p>

									In fact, the city has more than sufficient housing supply compared its Peer Cities.

									<br></br>  <br></br>
									<p>The crux of the issue lies in affordability, particularly due to the significant increase in the average permit value for single-family units in Escondido over the past two years. While the rest of the county experienced a decrease in permit values, Escondido stands as an outlier with a notable surge. This trend can be attributed, in part, to the acquisition of the mall by Steerpoint Capital and Bridge Group Investments from Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield earlier this year for $57 million, which has subsequently led to a surge in home prices in the surrounding areas.

										Initially, this surge may have been perceived as a competitive advantage for city officials, reflecting economic growth and increased property values. However, it is vital for city officials and relevant stakeholders to carefully manage these outliers to prevent them from overpowering and distorting the broader real estate market dynamics.</p>

						<p>Balancing the economic benefits of such high-profile transactions with the need to maintain housing affordability for residents is crucial. It necessitates a thoughtful approach that includes measures like implementing effective zoning policies, encouraging diverse housing options, and supporting affordable housing initiatives. By proactively addressing these challenges, city officials can safeguard the overall health of the real estate market and ensure that the community's long-term interests are protected, thus maintaining a sustainable and balanced housing market in Escondido.</p>
