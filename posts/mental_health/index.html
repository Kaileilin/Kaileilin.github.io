							<h1><b>California is not on track to meet 2030 emissions goals </b></h1>
							<h3>
To achieve the ambitious 2030 target of reducing emissions by 40% below 1990 levels, California must significantly accelerate its efforts. Currently, the state is averaging a modest annual reduction rate of approximately 1.5% over the past decade. To reach the required pace, this rate must be tripled, necessitating an increase to about 4.6% annually.</h3>

California has worked hard to decouple its economy from the burning of fossil fuels, resulting in some of the lowest per-capita emissions in the United States, but annual greenhouse gas jumped 3.4% in 2021, a rebound following the pandemic, according to the latest data from the California Air Resources Board (CARB).The 2021 emissions remained 121.3 MMTCO2e above the 2030 target of nearly 260 MMTCO2e.</p>

							 <h2><i>If you look at the trajectory since 2010, California won’t meet the 2030 climate goal until 2051. We need to triple the rate of decarbonization progress each year to hit that target
							</i></h2>

							<p>To meet that benchmark, California would need to triple the rate of emissions cuts we’ve made since 2010—going from the actual average annual reduction of about 1.5% a year to about 4.6% a year. Moreover, to meet the next climate goal in 2050, California needs to cut 5.3% of current emissions every year from 2030 onwards. However, the only two times that California had cut this much was during the two recessions – 2009 and 2020, where it cut 6.1% and 8.8%, respectively.

							<p>Emissions from the transportation sector—which accounts for nearly 40% of the state’s carbon footprint—increased by 7.4% from 2020 to 2021 following the easing of pandemic travel restrictions. But overall, greenhouse gas emissions from passenger cars, heavy-duty trucks, and other vehicles were more than 10% lower in 2021 compared to 2019. This shows the state is making considerable progress cutting its largest source of pollution. Emissions from heavy-duty vehicles have consistently decreased every year since 2018, resulting in a 14.1% reduction in 2021 compared to that year. </p>
					
						<h2><i>  At the current trajectory (an increase in sales of 25.6% on average per year from 2018 to 2023), California is on track to meet the 2030 target of 5 million ZEVs one year ahead of schedule
							  </i></h2>

							   <p>Zero-emission vehicle adoption is now at an all-time high in California, accounting for a quarter of new vehicle sales in 2023. New light-duty electric vehicle sales in all classes rose by 61.7% in 2022 compared to the previous year, and the state met its 2025 goal of 1.5 million ZEVs on-road two years early in April 2023. At the current trajectory (an increase in sales of 25.6% on average per year from 2018 to 2023), California is on track to meet the 2030 target of 5 million ZEVs one year ahead of schedule.</p>

									<p>The crux of the issue lies in affordability, particularly due to the significant increase in the average permit value for single-family units in Escondido over the past two years. While the rest of the county experienced a decrease in permit values, Escondido stands as an outlier with a notable surge. This trend can be attributed, in part, to the acquisition of the mall by Steerpoint Capital and Bridge Group Investments from Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield earlier this year for $57 million, which has subsequently led to a surge in home prices in the surrounding areas.

										Initially, this surge may have been perceived as a competitive advantage for city officials, reflecting economic growth and increased property values. However, it is vital for city officials and relevant stakeholders to carefully manage these outliers to prevent them from overpowering and distorting the broader real estate market dynamics.</p>

						<p>Balancing the economic benefits of such high-profile transactions with the need to maintain housing affordability for residents is crucial. It necessitates a thoughtful approach that includes measures like implementing effective zoning policies, encouraging diverse housing options, and supporting affordable housing initiatives. By proactively addressing these challenges, city officials can safeguard the overall health of the real estate market and ensure that the community's long-term interests are protected, thus maintaining a sustainable and balanced housing market in Escondido.</p>
