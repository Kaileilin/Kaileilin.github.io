          through in-depth industry analysis and simultaneously designs workforce development strategies.
          <br></br>Of course, to recruit such workers to the area, there must be a concrete strategy to improve the
availability of housing and (for remote workers) the quality of internet connection. A lack of affordable,
quality housing in the most desirable parts of Auburn forces potential residents to look
elsewhere. Here, I made the maps to capture trends in the local rental market.

          <div class="body-text">Auburn’s shortage of industrial land, not to mention regulatory challenges like Measure S, and the lack of greenfield opportunities, mean that there are very few opportunities for it to host large fabrication facilities, especially those such as Qualcomm’s Sorrento Valley plant. However, this should not exclude the city from participating in the regional manufacturing
            cluster because before any manufacturer becomes as big as Qualcomm, it must proceed through the firm life cycle.</div>
          <div class="body-text">A focus on entrepreneur-led development implies a lifestyle-led strategy. Because they tend to also have lower capital costs, they are more likely to choose a location based on personal lifestyle preferences than, say, local tax rates or transport costs.</div>

              <span class="image-caption">Figure.2. This figure plots the location quotient (LQ) for industries in Auburn in 2016 and 2021. A location
                quotient is a statistic representing the degree of concentration of employment in a location. An
                LQ greater than 1 implies more people are employed in that industry than the city’s population
                would lead one to expect, while an LQ less than 1 implies there are fewer people employed than
                the city’s population would expect. The LQ also provides insight on whether the city “exports” or
                “imports” goods and services in a particular industry: LQs greater than 1 imply the city exports
                that industry’s goods and/or services, and an LQ less than 1 implies the city imports these instead.
                We can gain understanding into a city’s economic role within a regional economy by looking at
                its LQs in various industries.
                <br></br>
                Over the 2016 - 2021 period, Auburn experienced a transition in its employment composition and
                LQ. The city saw shifts away from primary or upstream industries (Agriculture, Manufacturing,
                Logistics, and Wholesale Trade) and toward more service-oriented industries such as Administration,
                Information, Hospitality, and Professional Services.</span>
                <br></br>
                In 2021, City of Auburn also saw construction becoming
                outsized, growing to provide services for the greater region. Specifically, Auburn leds the the rest of San Diego County in Serveral industries including Agriculutre, retail Trade, Wholesale Trade and Other services except public administration.

              <img src="../assets/images/Industry change .png" class="gallery-image">
              <span class="image-caption">In 2021, Auburn witnessed substantial employment growth in Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing, and Mining, following greater-than-average job losses during the previous year's pandemic-related layoffs. On the other hand, most other industries in Auburn experienced more moderate changes in employment, mirroring the trends seen across California as a whole. This entailed a decline in employment in Wholesale Trade, Arts, Entertainment, and Hospitality, alongside notable growth in Logistics and Construction.
                <br></br>
                Interestingly, despite a statewide decrease in retail employment, Auburn actually saw year-over-year growth in this sector. Overall, the city of Auburn witnessed more pronounced fluctuations in employment due to its smaller employment base compared to the state as a whole.</span>
