						<p>Welcome! This portfolio showcases the art of data storytelling through my creative map works as well as data science projects, including Quantitative Modeling, Data engineering work that I have completed. Inherently, data science is a complex endeavor, but when care is taken to craft a compelling story accompanied by intuitive graphics, technical statistics can transform into powerful business insights.</p>
						<p>A little bit about my self  - I graduated from the University of Southern California with a Master’s Degree in Spatial Data Science in December 2020, where I developed my skills in Machine Learning, Statistics, Python Coding and Big Data Management. Currently, I work at Beacon Economics, LLC and the UCR Center for Economic Forecasting and Development where I implement quantitative modeling and data science methods in economic research, providing data-driven solutions to a wide range of clients, including private companies, non-profit organizations, and governments.
							Previously, I worked as a product Analyst Intern at a Tech Start-up Tusimple, where I was responsible for delivering high-quaity map producsts that used to navigate self-driving vehicles.
